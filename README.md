collabarative assignment

This is a group assignment. Please find a group (either 2 or 3 people for each group). Add yourself to a group under "People --> Module 8 Assignment Groups". Only one person in each group needs to submit 
the assignment. You can choose which group member's "to do list" application to use for this assignment (i.e., the group member with the most complete application).

[23 points] Use JMeter to perform load testing on your "To Do List" application's web UI. Submit screen shots of JMeter, showing the resulting performance numbers and graphs.

[7 points] Create a table of 10 anti-patterns and 10 code smells that you learned about in the Review section, with a row for each anti-pattern and code smell. It should include the following columns,

Name
Category (architectural, application-level, class-level, etc.)
Severity (1-10), with higher severities resulting in worse maintainability
Then, answer the following questions,

How are code maintainability and simplicity related?
Runtime efficiency and code simplicity are often competing goals. How can you deal with this problem? Is it possible to have code that is both simple and efficient?
